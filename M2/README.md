Deliverable:
  1. 5%: A demo the replicated the Arduino official examples:
      1. Printing out WiFi RSSI;
         - Code for this part is in WiFi_Demo folder
      2. Controlling Arduino LED using a smart phone;
         - Code for this part is in BlueTooth_Demo filder
  2. 5%: Showing IMU data being streamed from Arduino to another device (e.g., laptop terminal print-outs of real-time IMU data);
     - Code for laptop central is in test.js file
     - Code for arduino board is in BLE_Streaming folder
